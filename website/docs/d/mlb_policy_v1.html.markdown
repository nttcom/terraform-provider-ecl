## Attributes Reference

`id` is set to the ID of the found policy.<br>
In addition, the following attributes are exported:

* `name` - Name of the policy
* `description` - Description of the policy
* `tags` - Tags of the policy (JSON object format)
* `configuration_status` - Configuration status of the policy
    * `"ACTIVE"`
        * There are no configurations of the policy that waiting to be applied
    * `"CREATE_STAGED"`
        * The policy has been added and waiting to be applied
    * `"UPDATE_STAGED"`
        * Changed configurations of the policy exists that waiting to be applied
    * `"DELETE_STAGED"`
        * The policy has been removed and waiting to be applied
* `operation_status` - Operation status of the load balancer which the policy belongs to
    * `"NONE"` :
        * There are no operations of the load balancer
        * The load balancer and related resources can be operated
    * `"PROCESSING"`
        * The latest operation of the load balancer is processing
        * The load balancer and related resources cannot be operated
    * `"COMPLETE"`
        * The latest operation of the load balancer has been succeeded
        * The load balancer and related resources can be operated
    * `"STUCK"`
        * The latest operation of the load balancer has been stopped
        * Operators of NTT Communications will investigate the operation
        * The load balancer and related resources cannot be operated
    * `"ERROR"`
        * The latest operation of the load balancer has been failed
        * The operation was roll backed normally
        * The load balancer and related resources can be operated
* `load_balancer_id` - ID of the load balancer which the policy belongs to
* `tenant_id` - ID of the owner tenant of the policy
* `algorithm` - Load balancing algorithm (method) of the policy
* `persistence` - Persistence setting of the policy
    * If `listener.protocol` is `"http"` or `"https"`, `"cookie"` is available
* `idle_timeout` - The duration (in seconds) during which a session is allowed to remain inactive
    * There may be a time difference up to 60 seconds, between the set value and the actual timeout
