## Attributes Reference

`id` is set to the ID of the found load balancer.<br>
In addition, the following attributes are exported:

* `name` - Name of the load balancer
* `description` - Description of the load balancer
* `tags` - Tags of the load balancer (JSON object format)
* `configuration_status` - Configuration status of the load balancer
    * `"ACTIVE"`
        * There are no configurations of the load balancer that waiting to be applied
    * `"CREATE_STAGED"`
        * The load balancer has been added and waiting to be applied
    * `"UPDATE_STAGED"`
        * Changed configurations of the load balancer exists that waiting to be applied
* `monitoring_status` - Monitoring status of the load balancer
    * `"ACTIVE"`
        * The load balancer is operating normally
    * `"INITIAL"`
        * The load balancer is not deployed and does not monitored
    * `"UNAVAILABLE"`
        * The load balancer is not operating normally
* `operation_status` - Operation status of the load balancer
    * `"NONE"` :
        * There are no operations of the load balancer
        * The load balancer and related resources can be operated
    * `"PROCESSING"`
        * The latest operation of the load balancer is processing
        * The load balancer and related resources cannot be operated
    * `"COMPLETE"`
        * The latest operation of the load balancer has been succeeded
        * The load balancer and related resources can be operated
    * `"STUCK"`
        * The latest operation of the load balancer has been stopped
        * Operators of NTT Communications will investigate the operation
        * The load balancer and related resources cannot be operated
    * `"ERROR"`
        * The latest operation of the load balancer has been failed
        * The operation was roll backed normally
        * The load balancer and related resources can be operated
* `primary_availability_zone` - The zone / group where the primary virtual server of load balancer is deployed
* `secondary_availability_zone` - The zone / group where the secondary virtual server of load balancer is deployed
* `active_availability_zone` - Primary or secondary availability zone where the load balancer is currently running
    * Return `"UNDEFINED"` if can not define active availability zone
* `revision` - Revision of the load balancer
* `plan_id` - ID of the plan
* `plan_name` - Name of the plan
* `tenant_id` - ID of the owner tenant of the load balancer
* `syslog_servers` - Syslog servers to which access logs are transferred
    * Only access logs to listeners which `protocol` is either `"http"` or `"https"` are transferred
    * When `protocol` of `syslog_servers` is `"tcp"`
        * Access logs are transferred to all healthy syslog servers specified in `syslog_servers`
    * When `protocol` of `syslog_servers` is `"udp"`
        * Access logs are transferred to the syslog server specified first in `syslog_servers` as long as it is healthy
        * Access logs are transferred to the syslog server specified second (last) in `syslog_servers` when the first syslog server is not healthy
    * Structure is [documented below](#syslog-servers)
* `interfaces` - Interfaces that attached to the load balancer
    * Structure is [documented below](#interfaces)

<a name="syslog-servers"></a>The `syslog_servers` block contains:

* `ip_address` - IP address of the syslog server
    * The load balancer sends ICMP to this IP address for health check purpose
* `port` - Port number of the syslog server
* `protocol` - Protocol of the syslog server

<a name="interfaces"></a>The `interfaces` block contains:

* `network_id` - ID of the network that this interface belongs to
* `virtual_ip_address` - Virtual IP address of the interface within subnet
    * Do not use this IP address at the interface of other devices, allowed address pairs, etc
* `reserved_fixed_ips` - IP addresses that are pre-reserved for applying configurations of load balancer to be performed without losing redundancy
    * Structure is [documented below](#reserved-fixed-ips)

<a name="reserved-fixed-ips"></a>The `reserved_fixed_ips` block contains:

* `ip_address` - The IP address assign to this interface within subnet
    * Do not use this IP address at the interface of other devices, allowed address pairs, etc
