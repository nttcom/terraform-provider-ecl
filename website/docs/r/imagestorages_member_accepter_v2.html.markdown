resource "ecl_imagestorages_member_accepter_v2" "accepter_1" {

	status = "accepted"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `region` - (Optional, **DEPRECATED**) The region in which to obtain the V2 Imagestorage client.
    Images are associated with accounts, but a Imagestroage client is needed to
    create one. If omitted, the `region` argument of the provider is used.
    Changing this creates a new image.

* `image_member_id` - (Required) An identifier for the image and member. You can refer it from ID of member resource. The format is "${image_id}/${member_id}", where member_id is accepter project ID.

* `status` - (Required) The status of this image member. Must be one of "pending", "accepted", "rejected".


## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:
