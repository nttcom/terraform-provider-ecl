# ecl\_mlb\_policy\_v1

Manages a policy within Enterprise Cloud Managed Load Balancer.

-> **Note** Apply changes of a policy to the Managed Load Balancer instance using [ecl_mlb_load_balancer_action_v1](./ecl_mlb_load_balancer_action_v1) in another tf file.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ecl_mlb_tls_policy_v1" "tlsv1_2_202210_01" {
  name = "TLSv1.2_202210_01"
}

resource "ecl_mlb_certificate_v1" "certificate" {
  # ~ snip ~
}

resource "ecl_mlb_load_balancer_v1" "load_balancer" {
  # ~ snip ~
}

resource "ecl_mlb_health_monitor_v1" "health_monitor" {
  # ~ snip ~
}

resource "ecl_mlb_listener_v1" "listener" {
  # ~ snip ~
}

resource "ecl_mlb_target_group_v1" "target_group" {
  # ~ snip ~
}

resource "ecl_mlb_policy_v1" "policy" {
  name        = "policy"
  description = "description"
  tags = {
    key = "value"
  }
  algorithm               = "round-robin"
  persistence             = "cookie"
  idle_timeout            = 600
  sorry_page_url          = "https://example.com/sorry"
  source_nat              = "enable"
  certificate_id          = ecl_mlb_certificate_v1.certificate.id
  health_monitor_id       = ecl_mlb_health_monitor_v1.health_monitor.id
  listener_id             = ecl_mlb_listener_v1.listener.id
  default_target_group_id = ecl_mlb_target_group_v1.target_group.id
  tls_policy_id           = data.ecl_mlb_tls_policy_v1.tlsv1_2_202210_01.id
  load_balancer_id        = ecl_mlb_load_balancer_v1.load_balancer.id
}
```

        * Nested structure is permitted
    * This field accepts single-byte characters only
* `algorithm` - (Optional) Load balancing algorithm (method) of the policy
    * Must be one of these values:
        * `"round-robin"`
        * `"weighted-round-robin"`
        * `"least-connection"`
        * `"weighted-least-connection"`
        * `"source-ip-port-hash"`
* `persistence` - (Optional) Persistence setting of the policy
    * If `listener.protocol` is `"http"` or `"https"`, `"cookie"` is available
    * Must be one of these values:
        * `"none"`
        * `"source-ip"`
        * `"cookie"`
* `idle_timeout` - (Optional) The duration (in seconds) during which a session is allowed to remain inactive
    * There may be a time difference up to 60 seconds, between the set value and the actual timeout
    * If `listener.protocol` is `"tcp"` or `"udp"`
        * Default value is 120
    * If `listener.protocol` is `"http"` or `"https"`
        * Default value is 600
        * On session timeout, the load balancer sends TCP RST packets to both the client and the real server
* `sorry_page_url` - (Optional) URL of the sorry page to which accesses are redirected if all members in the target group are down
    * If `listener.protocol` is `"http"` or `"https"`, this parameter can be set
    * If `listener.protocol` is neither `"http"` nor `"https"`, must not set this parameter or set `""`
