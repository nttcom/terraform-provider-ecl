# ecl_dedicated_hypervisor_server_v1

Manages a dedicated hypervisor v1 Server resource within Enterprise Cloud.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ecl_baremetal_flavor_v2" "gp1" {
    name = "General Purpose 1 v2"
}

data "ecl_imagestorages_image_v2" "esxi" {
    name = "vSphere_ESXi-6.0.u2_64_dedicated-hypervisor_01"
}

data "ecl_baremetal_availability_zone_v2" "groupa" {
    zone_name = "zone1-groupa"
}

resource "ecl_network_network_v2" "network_1" {
    name = "dedicated_hypervisor_network"
    plane = "data"
}

resource "ecl_network_subnet_v2" "subnet_1" {
    name = "dedicated_hypervisor_subnet"
    network_id = "${ecl_network_network_v2.network_1.id}"
    cidr = "192.168.1.0/24"
    gateway_ip = "192.168.1.1"
    allocation_pools {
        start = "192.168.1.100"
        end = "192.168.1.200"
    }
}

resource "ecl_dedicated_hypervisor_server_v1" "server_1" {
    depends_on = [
        "ecl_network_subnet_v2.subnet_1"
    ]

    name = "server1"
    description = "ESXi Dedicated Hypervisor"
    networks {
        uuid = "${ecl_network_network_v2.network_1.id}"
        fixed_ip = "192.168.1.10"
        plane = "data"
        segmentation_id = 4
    }
    networks {
        uuid = "${ecl_network_network_v2.network_1.id}"
        fixed_ip = "192.168.1.11"
        plane = "data"
        segmentation_id = 4
    }
    admin_pass = "aabbccddeeff"
    image_ref = "${data.ecl_imagestorages_image_v2.esxi.id}"
    flavor_ref = "${data.ecl_baremetal_flavor_v2.gp1.id}"
    availability_zone = "${data.ecl_baremetal_availability_zone_v2.groupa.zone_name}"
    metadata = {
        k1 = "v1"
        k2 = "v2"
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) Name of your Dedicated Hypervisor/Baremetal server as a string.

* `description` - (Optional) Description of your Dedicated Hypervisor server as a string.
    Changing this creates a new server.

* `image_ref` - (Required) The image reference for the desired image for your Dedicated Hypervisor server. 
    Specify as an UUID or full URL. Changing this creates a new server.

* `flavor_ref` - (Required) The flavor reference for the desired flavor for your Dedicated Hypervisor server. 
    Specify as an UUID or full URL. Changing this creates a new server.

* `availability_zone` - (Optional) The availability zone name in which to launch the server. 
    If omit this parameter, target availability_zone is random. Changing this creates a new server.

* `networks` - (Required) An array of networks to attach to the server. 
    The `networks` object structure is documented below. Changing this creates a new server.

* `metadata` - (Optional) Metadata key and value pairs. Changing this creates a new server.

* `admin_pass` - (Optional) Password for the administrator. Changing this creates a new server.

The `networks` block supports:

* `uuid` - (Required unless `port` is provided) The network UUID to attach to the server. 
    Changing this creates a new server.

* `port` - (Required unless `uuid` is provided) The port UUID of a network to attach to the server.
    Changing this creates a new server.

* `fixed_ip` - (Optional) Specifies a fixed IPv4 address to be used on this network. 
    Changing this creates a new server.

* `plane` - (Required) The traffic type of a network to attach to the server. `data` and `storage` are supported. 
    Changing this creates a new server.
    
* `segmentation_id` - (Required) The segmentation ID of a network to attach to the server. 
    This value is integer, no less than 4 and no more than 4093. Changing this creates a new server.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `baremetal_server_id` - The UUID of created baremetal server.

## Import

Dedicated hypervisor servers can be imported using the `id`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import ecl_dedicated_hypervisor_server_v1.server_1 f42dbc37-4642-4628-8b47-50bf95d8fdd5
```
