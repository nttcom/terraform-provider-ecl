# ecl\_mlb\_target\_group\_v1

Manages a target group within Enterprise Cloud Managed Load Balancer.

-> **Note** Apply changes of a target group to the Managed Load Balancer instance using [ecl_mlb_load_balancer_action_v1](./ecl_mlb_load_balancer_action_v1) in another tf file.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ecl_mlb_load_balancer_v1" "load_balancer" {
  # ~ snip ~
}

resource "ecl_mlb_target_group_v1" "target_group" {
  name        = "target_group"
  description = "description"
  tags = {
    key = "value"
  }
  load_balancer_id = ecl_mlb_load_balancer_v1.load_balancer.id
  members {
    ip_address = "192.168.0.7"
    port       = 80
    weight     = 1
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Optional) Name of the target group
    * This field accepts single-byte characters only
* `description` - (Optional) Description of the target group
    * This field accepts single-byte characters only
* `tags` - (Optional) Tags of the target group
    * Set JSON object up to 32,768 characters
        * Nested structure is permitted
    * This field accepts single-byte characters only
* `load_balancer_id` - ID of the load balancer which the target group belongs to
* `members` - Members (real servers) of the target group
    * Structure is [documented below](#members)

<a name="members"></a>The `members` block contains:

* `ip_address` - IP address of the member (real server)
    * Set an unique combination of IP address and port in all members which belong to the same target group
    * Must not set a IP address which is included in `virtual_ip_address` and `reserved_fixed_ips` of load balancer interfaces that the target group belongs to
    * Must not set a IP address of listeners which belong to the same load balancer as the target group
    * Must not set a link-local IP address (RFC 3927) which includes Common Function Gateway
* `port` - Port number of the member (real server)
    * Set an unique combination of IP address and port in all members which belong to the same target group
* `weight` - (Optional) Weight for the member (real server)
    * If `policy.algorithm` is `"weighted-round-robin"` or `"weighted-least-connection"`, use this parameter
    * Set same weight for the combination of IP address and port in all members which belong to the same load balancer
