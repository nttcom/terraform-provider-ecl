# ecl\_mlb\_route\_v1

Manages a route within Enterprise Cloud Managed Load Balancer.

-> **Note** Apply changes of a route to the Managed Load Balancer instance using [ecl_mlb_load_balancer_action_v1](./mlb_load_balancer_action_v1) in another tf file. Please refer to [examples](https://github.com/nttcom/terraform-provider-ecl/tree/master/examples/managed-load-balancer) .

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ecl_network_network_v2" "network" {
  # ~ snip ~
}

resource "ecl_network_subnet_v2" "subnet" {
  network_id = ecl_network_network_v2.network.id
  cidr = "192.168.0.0/24"
}

resource "ecl_mlb_load_balancer_v1" "load_balancer" {
  # ~ snip ~
}

resource "ecl_mlb_route_v1" "route" {
  name        = "route"
  description = "description"
  tags = {
    key = "value"
  }
  destination_cidr    = "172.16.0.0/24"
  next_hop_ip_address = cidrhost(ecl_network_subnet_v2.subnet.cidr, 254)
  load_balancer_id    = ecl_mlb_load_balancer_v1.load_balancer.id
}
```

    * Set a CIDR which is not included in subnet of load balancer interfaces that the (static) route belongs to
    * Must not set a link-local CIDR (RFC 3927) which includes Common Function Gateway
* `next_hop_ip_address` - ID of the load balancer which the (static) route belongs to
    * Set a CIDR which is not included in subnet of load balancer interfaces that the (static) route belongs to
    * Must not set a network IP address and broadcast IP address
