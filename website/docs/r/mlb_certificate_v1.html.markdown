Manages a certificate within Enterprise Cloud Managed Load Balancer.

-> **Note** Apply changes of a certificate to the Managed Load Balancer instance using [ecl_mlb_load_balancer_action_v1](./mlb_load_balancer_action_v1) in another tf file. Please refer to [examples](https://github.com/nttcom/terraform-provider-ecl/tree/master/examples/managed-load-balancer) .

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ecl_mlb_certificate_v1" "certificate" {
  name        = "certificate"
  description = "description"
  tags = {
    key = "value"
  }
  ca_cert = {
    content = filebase64("${path.module}/certificate/ca_cert.pem")
  }
  ssl_cert = {
    content = filebase64("${path.module}/certificate/ssl_cert.crt")
  }
  ssl_key = {
    content = filebase64("${path.module}/certificate/ssl_key.key")
  }
}
```
