# ecl\_mlb\_health\_monitor\_v1

Manages a health monitor within Enterprise Cloud Managed Load Balancer.

-> **Note** Apply changes of a health monitor to the Managed Load Balancer instance using [ecl_mlb_load_balancer_action_v1](./ecl_mlb_load_balancer_action_v1) in another tf file.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ecl_mlb_load_balancer_v1" "load_balancer" {
  # ~ snip ~
}

resource "ecl_mlb_health_monitor_v1" "health_monitor" {
  name        = "health_monitor"
  description = "description"
  tags = {
    key = "value"
  }
  port             = 80
  protocol         = "http"
  interval         = 5
  retry            = 3
  timeout          = 5
  path             = "/health"
  http_status_code = "200-299"
  load_balancer_id = ecl_mlb_load_balancer_v1.load_balancer.id
}
```
